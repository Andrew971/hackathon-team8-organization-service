    Type: Number
    Description: The limit of how many bytes that a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. You can specify an integer value from 1024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262144 bytes (256 KiB).

  ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds:
    Type: Number
    Description: Specifies the duration, in seconds, that the ReceiveMessage action call waits until a message is in the queue in order to include it in the response, as opposed to returning an empty response if a message isn't yet available.
